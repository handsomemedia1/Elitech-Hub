## 🎯 Recommended Setup

For **Elitech Hub**, I recommend:

1. **Development:** Use `serve_website.py` for local testing
2. **Production:** Deploy to Netlify or Vercel
3. **Custom Domain:** Point your domain DNS to Netlify/Vercel

### Setting Up Custom Domain

After deploying to Netlify:
1. Go to Site settings → Domain management
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Add your domain (e.g., `elitechhub.com`)
4. Update your DNS records:
   - Add A record: `75.2.60.5`
   - Or CNAME: `yoursite.netlify.app`
5. Wait for DNS propagation (~24 hours max)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Port 8000 is busy
The script will automatically find another available port.

### Python not found
Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

### Deployment fails
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure you're logged in to the platform
- Verify all files are present

### Website looks broken after deployment
